# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the develop branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    env:
      SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY }}
      SSH_USER: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
      SSH_ADDR: ${{ secrets.SSH_ADDR }}

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: pull and deploy
        run: |
              echo "$SECRET_KEY" > secret_key
              chmod 600 secret_key
              ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no ${SSH_USER}@${SSH_ADDR} -i secret_key "cd elm-web && ./deploy.sh"
